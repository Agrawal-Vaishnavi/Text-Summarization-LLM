Text summarization using BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers)

BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) model is used which combines bidirectional encoding of BERT with the 
autoregressive decoding of GPT to build a sequence-to-sequence model to summarize text. It determines important information in the 
text by attention mechanisms and learned patterns from news articles to understand high information content.
